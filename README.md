# C-_DBMS-GUI-
Final Project for DBMS. I used C# for the GUI and MySQL as the database.
This is an app where the Priest and his executives specifcally the secretary are able to create
schedules(add, remove, edit). This project is an implementation of the creation of a fully functional
application where MySql and C#(WFP) are the main components of this project.

Update 0:
Updated the app to be able to traverse through the different functionated gui's.
Can now add data and gain an access view within a database.

Still testing and developing. Will improve further beyond.

Update 1:
Now able to add an event through the use of existing registered names as PK. How it works is simple,
simply use the PK for the registered individuals as a root in which can be used as a reference to set
an event.

GUI updated. Not the best but it works.
Create a bunch of different functions one for most is the ability to submit the entered event details
into the existing localhost database specified table.

Next update:
Will be adding final touches slowly, and the ability to remove certain datas in rows, search names and 
Merry Christmas

Final changes have been made.
Current Update I will name it as final build. Version 5.0 which is the complete app. 23-12-2023
