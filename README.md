# C-_DBMS-GUI-
Final Project for DBMS. I used C# for the GUI and MySQL as the database.
This is an app where the Priest and his executives specifcally the secretary are able to create
schedules(add, remove, edit). This project is an implementation of the creation of a fully functional
application where MySql and C#(WFP) are the main components of this project.

Update:
Updated the app to be able to traverse through the different functionated gui's.
Can now add data and gain an access view within a database.

Still testing and developing. Will improve further beyond.
